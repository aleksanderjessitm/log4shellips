## A List Of IPs That Scanned For The Log4j Vulnerability

This repository lets you run a script that will create a csv file called "ips.csv" with the list of IPs that scanned for the Log4j vulnerability commonly called ["log4shell"](https://www.itmagination.com/blog/360deg-it-check-25-log4j-react-line-tailwind-css).

In this repo there is also a script called `build.bash` that lets you build the project for Linux, macOS, and Windows that run on amd64, and arm64 platforms.

Here in the repo, I have also included the `ips.csv` file to see how the output will look like.

### Happy Hacking!
